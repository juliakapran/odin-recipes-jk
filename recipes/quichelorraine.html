        <p>Prep time: 10mins-----Cooking time: 40mins-----<b>Total time: 50mins</b></p>

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 frozen deep dish pie crust. I use a simple pie crust from <a href="https://cozypeachkitchen.com/oil-pie-crust/">Cozy Peach Kitchen</a>.</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion (110g) finely diced</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>3/4 cup egg whites (180g)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup low fat evaporated milk* (180g). I use a heaping TBSP of sour cream diluted with a quarter cup water.</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp Italian seasoning. I use Spicy Italian from Trader Joe's.</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>    
            <li>1/4 tsp ground pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup 8-oz. diced ham. I prefer Uncured Ham.</li>
            <li>1/2 cup 2% shredded sharp cheddar cheese (56g)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup provolone cheese, cubed/shredded (28g)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp fresh herbs chopped – like parsley, basil, or cilantro...or all three!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Gently transfer the pie crust to a pie dish. </li>
            <li>Spray a small skillet with cooking spray and set to medium-high heat. Add the diced onion and cook for 3-5 minutes or until soft and translucent. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Whisk the eggs in a large bowl until lightly beaten. Then whisk in the egg whites, milk, minced garlic, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper (you can add more or less salt and pepper to taste). Stir in the sautéed onions, ham, both cheeses, and fresh herbs.</li>
            <li>Bake on the lower oven rack for 37 to 45 minutes, or until set along the edges and only slightly jiggly in the center.</li>
            <li>Top with more fresh herbs to serve.</li>
        </ol>
